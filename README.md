# Training_Tracks
This was my final project for an introduction to object-oriented programming in Python. 
The app lets a user add new categories and workouts. 
It also lets them track sets and repetitions.


The app implements SQLite3 as a database to let the user actually store information.
The slqalchemy module is what I used as an ORM to tie the database to the models.
